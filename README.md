I## Readme for Getting and Cleaning Data Programming Assignemnt

 
### Contents 
The repository contains my work for the August 2015 session of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data"   Course Project. 

#### The assignement
The assignment consisted of providing 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
